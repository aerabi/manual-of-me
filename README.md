# Manual of Me

## Working Style

- **Primary working hours**: Monday to Friday between 0900 and 1700.
- **Primary working location**: Office (might do more home-office through time, as none of my teammates are in Freiburg)
- **Focus time**: I have 3 focusing mode:
  + _Not focused_: It's when I don't have a headphone on.
  + _Focused_: It's when I have wireless headphones on. In that mode, I can be interrupted for hugging you goodbye or answering if I'm coming to the lunch.
  + _Hyper-focused_: It's when I have wired headphones on with Death Metal being played in them. In that mode, please send me a IM message and I'll get back to you.
- **Ideal working environment**: Dark and quiet.

## Communication Preferences

- **IM messages**: Sending me messages on Slack or Teams is the preferred communication channel.
- **E-mail**: Don't send emails. I won't read those.
- **Phone/video call**: Those are only taken only if scheduled in advance. You can call me if I'm late for an appointment.
- **Personal approach**: I appreciate in-person communication. You can walk to me if I'm not in the _hyper-focused_ mode.

## Feedback and Recognition

- **How do you prefer to receive feedback?** In written, especially if it's structured. You can present the written feedback in a one-on-one session though.
- **How often do you like to receive feedback?** ASAP.
- **What types of recognition do you find most motivating?** Public acknowledgment, private appreciation, new opportunities, everything. 

## Stress Management

- **How might colleagues recognize when you're feeling stressed?** I bite.
- **What strategies do you use to manage stress at work?** Mortal Kombat.
 
## Quirks and Preferences

- I **joke around** too much. Please don't get offended.
- My **German** sucks. Please let's have conversations in English before my probation period ends.
